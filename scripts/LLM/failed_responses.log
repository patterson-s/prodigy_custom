**Analysis Process Explanation:**

I followed the abductive approach, focusing on the relational aspect of diplomatic speech and the construction of status relationships. Here's a breakdown of my reasoning for each step:

1. **Initial Assessment:** I carefully read each summary, identifying key themes and relationships. The central focus in all summaries is the relationship between the United Nations and Spain, with varying degrees of emphasis on the Franco regime and the need for guidance or support.

2. **Rhetorical Analysis:** I identified the fundamental diplomatic move in each summary, which was consistently the advocacy for relationship guidance or support. This act positions the Norwegian delegation as seeking to establish or strengthen the relationship between the United Nations and Spain.

3. **Content Analysis:** I analyzed the content domains and themes, such as the target state (Spain), the nature of the regime (oppressive, totalitarian), and the desired actions (guidance, support, freedom). These elements support the rhetorical act of advocacy.

4. **Label Generation:** The core rhetorical act is consistently advocacy, with variations in the specific focus (relationship guidance or support). This label captures the fundamental diplomatic move.

5. **Tag Assignment:** I identified relevant content domains and standardized terminology, ensuring consistency across summaries. Tags were assigned to capture the specific aspects of each summary, such as the target state, nature of rule, and desired actions.

6. **Output Validation:** I ensured the JSON format was followed, labels met the criteria of being mutually exclusive and focusing on the relational aspect, and tags were properly formatted.

This systematic approach allowed me to identify patterns and consistently categorize the diplomatic speech summaries based on the relational aspects and theoretical framework provided.
