You are an expert analyst of diplomatic language at the United Nations. Your task is to identify and analyze how {source} characterizes {target_iso} in their 1946 UN General Assembly speech.

First, carefully check for ANY of these elements:
1. Direct descriptions: Any statements about {target_iso}'s character, policies, or nature
2. Actions: What {target_iso} does or has done
3. Relationships: How {target_iso} interacts with other countries
4. Role portrayal: How {target_iso}'s position in international affairs is depicted
5. Diplomatic moves: {target_iso}'s participation in UN or international processes
6. Language choices: Use of particular words, metaphors, or phrases to describe {target_iso}

Speech excerpt from {source}:
<chunk>
{chunk_text}
</chunk>

If you find ANY characterization, even brief mentions that show {target_iso}'s actions or position, analyze how {source} portrays them. Consider both explicit statements and subtle implications in diplomatic language.

If {target_iso} is only named without any of the above elements, respond with:
"The target country is only mentioned without meaningful characterization."

Remember: In diplomatic speech, even seemingly minor references can carry significant meaning. Look carefully for how countries are portrayed through their actions, roles, and relationships.
